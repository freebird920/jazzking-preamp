# Jazz King Preamp 

## About this pedal
This preamp pedal was inspired by Fender Jazzking Amp. This amp is a solid state amp with 120W poweramp and 15' speaker. 

I use this preamp pedal with IR loader. It provides nice clean sound and enough headroom.

## Component information
The DC-DC converter I used in this board is TRACO TEC3-0923. Other DC-DC converter like MORSUN UWE 1215S-3WR3 will work.

PNP1 and TR3 are capacitance multiplier. In my case even with out CM there was no noise that I could notice. So you can use jumper across E-C to each TR's
