## Component information
The DC-DC converter I used in this board is TRACO TEC3-0923. Other DC-DC converter like MORSUN UWE 1215S-3WR3 will work.

PNP1 and TR3 are capacitance multiplier. In my case even with out CM there was no noise that I could notice. So you can use jumper across E-C to each TR's
